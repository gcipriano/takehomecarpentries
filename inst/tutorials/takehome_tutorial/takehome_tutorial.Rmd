## Welcome

This document contains a series of exercises to practice what you learned in your [_Carpentries_](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/) workshop.See the link for the lesson materials.



### Table of Contents

In this tutorial, you will practice how to:

* R Basics: read data into R, access subsets, plot data
* Create Functions
* Analyze Multiple Datasets
* Using if/else statements



## Getting Started with R

### Load the data

There are many ways to load data. While we will not use this dataset today, it is useful to know how to load a dataset directly from GitHub. See below for loading an example Tidy Tuesday dataset. Run the code to confirm that it was properly loaded.

```{r filter1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
measles <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-02-25/measles.csv')


head(measles)

# Using global assignment to use in subsequent exercises

assign("measles", measles, envir=globalenv())
```


Now go ahead and use the below codeblock to inspect the data and answer the questions below. 

```{r loaddata2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}




```

```{r q1, echo = FALSE}
question(" What are the dimensions of the dataframe?",
         answer("62342 x 20"),
         answer("10293 x 21"),
         answer("66113 x 16", correct = TRUE),
         answer("70493 x 15"),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

```{r q1a, echo = FALSE}
question(" What function do you use to view only the columnnames?",
         answer("cols()"),
         answer("colnames()", correct = TRUE),
         answer("columnnames()"),
         answer("namecols()"),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

```{r q1b, echo = FALSE}
question(" What does the function str() tell you?",
         answer("column names, value preview, dimensions, number of null values"),
         answer("column names, column types, number of null values"),
         answer("column names, column types"),
         answer("column names, column types, value preview, dimensions, classes of object", correct = TRUE),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

```{r q1c, echo = FALSE}
question(" What's the shortcut to print a value after variable assignment in your console if you didn't want to type print(new_value)?",
         answer("(measles_copy <- measles)", correct = TRUE),
         answer("measles_copy <- measles"),
         answer("View(measles_copy <- measles)", message = "Technically this opens it up in your viewer window, not your console"),
         answer("p(measles_copy <- measles)"),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```
###  Manipulating Dataframes

Use the below exercise box to answer the polls below: 

```{r manipulate_df, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}




```




```{r q2, echo = FALSE}
question(" What value is in the 10300th row in the 13th column?",
         answer("2.33"),
         answer("2", correct = TRUE),
         answer("NA"),
         answer("Arizona"),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

```{r q3, echo = FALSE}
question(" What values in the 50th row for columns titled 'year', 'name', and 'type'?",
         answer("2.33"),
         answer("2"),
         answer("NA"),
         answer("Arizona", correct = TRUE),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

```{r q4, echo = FALSE}
question(" What is the min and max of the column 'mmr'?",
         answer("10,99"),
         answer("1, 95"),
         answer("0, 90"),
         answer("-1, 100", correct = TRUE),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

```{r q5, echo = FALSE}
question(" Use the summary function to find the quartiles and mean for the xper, lat and lng columns. What are the mean values for each column?",
         answer("7, 38.2, -94.34"),
         answer("6.78, 39.15, -96.28", correct = TRUE),
         answer("5.36, 40.21, -89.97"),
         answer("8.20, 38.23, -90.36"),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```


This next question will combine concepts of subsetting and the function apply().

Print the unique values listed in the state column using the apply function. Feel free to try out the unique function on any column to preview what it does.



```{r apply_fn, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}




```

    <div id="apply_fn-hint">
    **Hint:** Be mindful of if you are applying the function across rows or columns. Remember 1 is across rows and 2 is across columns.
    </div>

```{r apply_fn-solution}

apply(df[,2], 2, unique )

```

###  

Good job! You can now see the results by running the name jan1 by itself. Or you can pass `jan1` to a function that takes data frames as input.

Did you notice that this code used the double assignment operator, `==`? `==` is one of R's logical comparison operators. Comparison operators are key to using `filter()` let's take a look at them.

## Practice Plotting

### Comparison operators

This exercise will combine previous lessons in subsetting data with the added task of plotting your data. 

```{r}
pi > 3
```

###  

When you place a logical test inside of `filter()`, filter applies the test to each row in the data frame and then returns the rows that pass, as a new data frame.

Our code above returned every row whose month value was equal to one _and_ whose day value was equal to one.

### Watch out!

When you start out with R, the easiest mistake to make is to test for equality with `=` instead of `==`. When this happens you'll get an informative error:

```{r, error = TRUE}
filter(flights, month = 1)
```

### Multiple tests

If you give `filter()` more than one logical test, `filter()` will combine the tests with an implied "and."In other words, `filter()` will return only the rows that return `TRUE` for every test. You can combine tests in other ways with Boolean operators... 

## Boolean operators

### &, |, and !

R uses boolean operators to combine multiple logical comparisons into a single logical test. These include `&` (_and_), `|` (_or_), `!` (_not_ or _negation_), and `xor()` (_exactly or_). 

Both `|` and `xor()` will return TRUE is one or the other logical comparison returns TRUE. `xor()` differs from `|` in that it will return FALSE if both logical comparisons return TRUE. The name _xor_ stands for _exactly or_.

Study the diagram below to get a feel for how these operators work.

```{r fig1, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "In the figure above, `x` is the left-hand circle, `y` is the right-hand circle, and the shaded region show which parts each operator selects."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/transform-logical.png")
```

### Test Your Knowledge

```{r logicals, echo = FALSE}
question(" What will the following code return? `filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)`",
         answer("Every flight that departed in November _or_ December", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Every flight that departed in November _and_ December", message = "Technically a flight could not have departed in November _and_ December unless it departed twice."),
         answer("Every flight _except for_ those that departed in November or December"),
         answer("An error. This is an incorrect way to combine tests.", message = "The next section will say a little more about combining tests."),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Common mistakes

In R, the order of operations doesn't work like English. You can't write `filter(flights, month == 11 | 12)`, even though you might say  "finds all flights that departed in November or December". Be sure to write oue a _complete_ test on each side of a boolean operator.

Here are four more tips to help you use logical tests and Boolean operators in R:

###  

1. A useful short-hand for this problem is `x %in% y`. This will select every row where `x` is one of the values in `y`. We could use it to rewrite the code in the question above:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    nov_dec <- filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12))
    ```

###  

2. Sometimes you can simplify complicated subsetting by remembering De Morgan's law: `!(x & y)` is the same as `!x | !y`, and `!(x | y)` is the same as `!x & !y`. For example, if you wanted to find flights that weren't delayed (on arrival or departure) by more than two hours, you could use either of the following two filters:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    filter(flights, !(arr_delay > 120 | dep_delay > 120))
    filter(flights, arr_delay <= 120, dep_delay <= 120)
    ```

###  

3. As well as `&` and `|`, R also has `&&` and `||`. Don't use them with `filter()`! You'll learn when you should use them later.

###  

4. Whenever you start using complicated, multipart expressions in `filter()`, consider making them explicit variables instead. That makes it much easier to check your work. You'll learn how to create new variables shortly.

## Missing values

### NA

Missing values can make comparisons tricky in R. R uses `NA` to represent missing or unknown values. `NA`s are "contagious" because almost any operation involving an unknown value (`NA`) will also be unknown (`NA`). For example, can you determine what value these expressions that use missing values shoudl evaluate to? Make a prediction and then click "Submit Answer".

```{r nas, exercise = TRUE, evaluate.exercise = FALSE}
NA > 5
10 == NA
NA + 10
NA / 2
```

```{r nas-check}
"In every case, R does not have enough information to compute a result. Hence, each result is an unknown value, `NA`."
```

### is.na()

The most confusing result above is this one:

```{r}
NA == NA
```
